Description: Fit and simulate bivariate correlated frailty models with
    proportional hazard structure. Frailty distributions, such as gamma and
    lognormal models are supported. Frailty variances of the two subjects 
    can be varied or equal. Details on the models are available in book of 
    Wienke (2011,ISBN:978-1-4200-7388-1). Bivariate gamma fit is obtained using the approach given 
    in Iachine (1995) with modifications. Lognormal fit is based on the approach
    by Ripatti and Palmgren (2000) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.01016.x>. Univariate
    and bivariate shared gamma frailty model fits are possible. Standard errors of
    the estimated covariate coefficients and frailty variance parameter are obtained using
    the approach given in Klein and Moeschberger (2003,ISBN:0-387-95399-X).
